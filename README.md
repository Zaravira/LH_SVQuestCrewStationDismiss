# Description

This mod lets you dismiss crew and quests from stations.

Both the quest and crew systems work the same way: A full list means it's almost never changing the available crew and quests, and an empty list gets new entries fast.
It's common practice people hire all crew from a station only to dismiss them in an effort to empty stations, but with quests it was far more hassle to do and people didn't bother.

Now you can clear the station from both quests and crew, with a simple click of a button in the station menu. Goodbye hassle! Hello new quests and crews!

# Installing
Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
